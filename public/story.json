        "description": "When I first adopted Luna, she was skittish and avoided people, especially men. She had been through some traumatic experiences in her previous home, and it took time before she started to trust me. I, too, had my own issues with trust. Life had shown me some tough lessons, and I found it hard to believe that anyone, or anything, could remain stable.The first few weeks were challenging. Every new person who came into our lives felt like a potential threat to Luna. She would bark and hide behind me, her eyes full of fear. I understood her, though; I’d been there. My own guard was up, and I struggled to let anyone close.Then Kevin entered the picture. Kevin had an innate calmness about him. He wasn’t intimidated by Luna’s hesitancy, nor was he quick to dismiss her. He sat with her quietly, allowing her to approach him when she was ready. I watched as he earned her trust, and I realized something: I could learn from him. Kevin wasn’t just showing Luna how to trust; he was also teaching me how to trust again. Slowly, as Luna became more comfortable, I did too. Together, we learned that trust doesn’t have to be given all at once—it’s something that’s built over time, with patience, consistency, and love. Now, Luna and I are in a better place. She’s more confident, and I feel a sense of peace that I haven’t felt in years. Kevin didn’t just bring stability into our lives; he brought a new way of seeing the world and, more importantly, ourselves.",
